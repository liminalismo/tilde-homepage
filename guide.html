    <h3><a name="tildeverse">What is a tilde?</a></h3>
    <p>A tilde (sometimes called a pubnix) is a public unix computer. This computer acts as a server, that is, a computer that serves content on the web, so other people can access it from somewhere on the internet. This includes you! You can access
      this computer from your physical computer, so you can see the stuff you host from a browser (for websites) or a client that can parse the files (for everything else, which is too huge a list to write down), and also access the system they are
      hosted in, through both the terminal and some graphic interfaces.</p>

    <p>The reason they're called tildes is a reference to the fact that user home directories in Unix are always prefaced by a tilde symbol (~) in the terminal-</p>

    <p>There are other tildes on the internet, and there's a hub for them in <a href=https://tildeverse.org">tildeverse.org</a>. There are services that all tilde users can access and that help tildenizens interact with others on the 'verse.'</p>

    <h3><a id="mail">E-Mail addresses and aliases</a></h3>
    <p>Every user on the liminalismo system gets a custom e-mail address on <em>yourusername</em>@liminalismo.com that you can give out to people from outside the server. All the mail sent to that address will be forwarded to the (external) e-mail
      account you gave us when you asked to join the tilde.</p>
    <p>If you want to reply from that e-mail address you will have to set up an alias on your external mail account; a quick search for "how to set up an alias in Gmail/Outlook/Mailbox/etc" on your engine of choice will bring up instructions on how
      to do so. Remember to use the SMTP server of your e-mail provider, as this tilde is not a mail server itself.</p>
