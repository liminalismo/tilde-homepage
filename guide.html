    <h3><a name="tildeverse">What is a tilde?</a></h3>
    <p>A tilde (sometimes called a pubnix) is a public unix computer. This computer acts as a server, that is, a computer that serves content on the web, so other people can access it from somewhere on the internet. This includes you! You can access
      this computer from your physical computer, so you can see the stuff you host from a browser (for websites) or a client that can parse the files (for everything else, which is too huge a list to write down), and also access the system they are
      hosted in, through both the terminal and some graphic interfaces.</p>

    <p>The reason they're called tildes is a reference to the fact that user home directories in Unix are always prefaced by a tilde symbol (~) in the terminal-</p>

    <p>There are other tildes on the internet, and there's a hub for them in <a href="https://tildeverse.org">tildeverse.org</a>. There are services that all tilde users can access and that help tildenizens interact with others on the 'verse.</p>

    <h3><a id="shell">Basic shell usage</a></h3>
    <h3><a id="html">Building a website</a></h3>
    <p>The main way tildenizens communicate with the people outside their server is through their personal websites, which in our tilde's case are accessible in-browser through liminalismo.com/~<em>username</em> and listed in our homepage's
      directory. Not all code can be parsed by a browser, but pages written in HTML can, and that's why it's the base language most people use to build their sites.</p>
    <p>Let's look at the basic building blocks of a simple site: HTML, CSS and Javascript.*
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>HTML:</em> It's the language in which the website's <em>content</em> is written, which means that the document that holds the page's <em>content</em> and <em>structure</em> will be written in HTML. It's mostly written in plain (also
        called natural) language enclosed by <em>tags</em>, which are elements that tell you what role do the words inside them fulfill inside the page. If you want to see an example of the way HTML looks, you can right-click this page and select the
        option to see the website's source code, where you'll access this page's .html source.</li>
      <li><em>CSS:</em> It's the language that styles the HTML content; in other words: HTML looks like plain text on a white background, and CSS is what makes it look the way you want by adding colors, fonts, shapes... It's a very versatile
        language. It's made up of selectors, properties and functions: the element that tells you what the style applies to, the style that it applies to the selector and the (optional, more advanced) value that you can use in some properties to
        create dynamic styles. If you want to see how a CSS document looks, you can right-click this page and select the option to inspect element. In the Sources tab, you can see this page's .css stylesheet.</li>
      <li><em>Javascript:</em> It's the language that tells the styled content how to behave. This is the most complex out of the three, but it's still quite simple and easy to learn. It makes your static website become dynamic by making the elements
        in HTML and the styles in CSS behave in different ways depending on how the person interacts with the page. We have opted to keep this simple and this page does not use Javascript, but <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/G2Shv.png">here's an
          example</a> of how Javascript code looks.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>* If you know your way around computers, you'll realize this is paring it down a lot, but bear with us, as this is meant to be a guide for beginners and it's important to take it one step at a time.</p>

    <p>If you want to learn how to use these three languages, we wholeheartedly recommend checking out the resources at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>, which are very accessible to beginners and immensely thorough. You can also ask <a href="https://liminalismo.com/~izzy">~izzy</a> to help you out, if the amount of content is too daunting.

    <h3><a id="mail">E-Mail addresses and aliases</a></h3>
    <p>Every user on the liminalismo system gets a custom e-mail address on <em>yourusername</em>@liminalismo.com that you can give out to people from outside the server. All the mail sent to that address will be forwarded to the (external) e-mail
      account you gave us when you asked to join the tilde.</p>
    <p>If you want to reply from that e-mail address you will have to set up an alias on your external mail account; a quick search for "how to set up an alias in Gmail/Outlook/Mailbox/etc" on your engine of choice will bring up instructions on how
      to do so. Remember to use the SMTP server of your e-mail provider, as this tilde is not a mail server itself.</p>
