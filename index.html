      <p>liminalismo is a shared linux system, which is sometimes called a pubnix or a tilde. this system is a tiny raspberry pi computer that physically exists somewhere in spain.</p>
      <p>we exist as an community space for people who want to make a personal page, or quite simply poke around SSH and low-resource programming. we firmly endorse the slow web movement and want to provide a space for people to socialize asynchronously, to express themselves outside of the constraints that certain web formats put on our words, art, and thoughts.</p>
